# BeeMoo Session Recovery Testing Guide

## 🎯 Overview
This tests the new session recovery system that handles disconnections and page refreshes.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### Client-Side
- **Automatic session persistence** - Saves room state to localStorage
- **Smart reconnection logic** - Exponential backoff with 5 retry attempts
- **Session recovery** - Attempts to rejoin previous room on reconnection
- **User notifications** - Shows status of recovery attempts
- **Graceful fallback** - Returns to landing page if recovery fails

### Server-Side
- **Session recovery handler** - Validates and restores user sessions
- **Disconnected user tracking** - Marks users as disconnected instead of removing
- **Automatic cleanup** - Removes users after 5 minutes of disconnection
- **Host reconnection** - Restores host privileges on successful recovery

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### 1. Network Disconnection Test
1. Join a room as host
2. Start a movie
3. Disable internet for 10 seconds
4. Re-enable internet
5. **Expected**: User stays in room, movie continues

### 2. Page Refresh Test
1. Join a room as participant
2. Refresh the browser page (F5)
3. **Expected**: User automatically rejoins the same room

### 3. Browser Close/Reopen Test
1. Join a room
2. Close browser completely
3. Reopen and navigate to BeeMoo
4. **Expected**: User rejoins if within 30 minutes

### 4. Host Disconnection Test
1. Host creates room with participants
2. Host disconnects
3. Participants see "Host disconnected" message
4. Host reconnects within 5 minutes
5. **Expected**: Host regains control, room reactivates

### 5. Long Disconnection Test
1. Join a room
2. Disconnect for 6+ minutes
3. Try to reconnect
4. **Expected**: Session expired, user goes to landing page

## 📱 User Experience

### Success Cases
- ✅ **Immediate recovery**: "Session recovered! Welcome back to the room."
- ✅ **No interruption**: Movie continues playing from where it left off
- ✅ **Preserved state**: Mic settings, host status all maintained

### Failure Cases
- ⚠️ **Room expired**: "Could not recover your session. Please rejoin the room."
- ❌ **Connection failed**: "Connection lost. Please check your internet and try again."

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Session Data Structure
```javascript
{
  roomCode: "ABC123",
  username: "User123", 
  isHost: true,
  timestamp: 1640995200000,
  socketId: "socket_id_123"
}
```

### Recovery Flow
1. **Page Load** → Check for session data
2. **Connect** → Attempt socket connection
3. **Recover** → Send recovery request to server
4. **Validate** → Server checks room exists + user was there
5. **Restore** → Update socket mappings, rejoin room
6. **Success** → User back in room with preserved state

### Cleanup Process
- **Immediate**: Mark as disconnected, preserve in room
- **5 minutes**: Auto-remove from room if not reconnected
- **30 minutes**: Clear session data from localStorage

## 🚀 Production Benefits

1. **Better UX**: No need to manually rejoin after network issues
2. **Reliability**: Handles temporary connection problems gracefully  
3. **Persistence**: Sessions survive browser refreshes
4. **Clean state**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
5. **Host continuity**: Movie parties can continue after host reconnects
